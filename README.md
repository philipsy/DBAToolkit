# DBAToolkit
This repository will include Powershell scripts and Transact-Sql to deal with simple DBA functions. 
The code is kept simple. I prefer scripts to be simple; if the logic was complex I would put create a fully-fledged utility
program. I hope the simplicity makes the intention clear, and that the script will be easier to modify, which may be
necessary as I have limited time and can only base them on Sql Server 2014.
